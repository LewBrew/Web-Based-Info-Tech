      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        This project is a command-line calculator written in the C programming language.
        The program allows users to select a mathematical operation and input two numbers
        to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Basic error handling
        is included to prevent division by zero and invalid menu selections.
