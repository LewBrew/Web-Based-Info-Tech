      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        Built a home media server using Plex by installing Plex Media Server on a desktop
        computer and organizing personal media into structured folders. Created separate
        libraries for movies, television shows, and music, then added these folders to Plex
        for automatic scanning and metadata matching. Configured basic server settings and
        tested streaming through the Plex web interface and a client device on the same
        local network to confirm proper playback and performance.
